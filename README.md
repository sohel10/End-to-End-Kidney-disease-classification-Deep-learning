## 🩺 End-to-End Kidney Disease Classification (Deep Learning + Grad-CAM)

This project builds an end-to-end deep learning system to classify four common kidney conditions from medical imaging:

Cyst Normal Kidney Kidney Stone Tumor

A custom TensorFlow CNN is trained using a modular MLOps workflow (DVC + MLflow + Pipelines).
To ensure trust and interpretability—critical for medical AI—we integrate Grad-CAM visual explanations.

## 🔍 1. Random Prediction Grid (Model Output)

Below is a 3×3 grid of randomly selected validation images.
Each tile displays the predicted class and model confidence.

📌 Useful for quick visual verification across patient cases.

🔥 2. Grad-CAM: Explainable AI for Medical Imaging

Deep learning models often act as “black boxes.”
To make the predictions interpretable, we use:

## 🧠 Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM)

Grad-CAM highlights which image regions the model focuses on during classification.
This helps clinicians and ML scientists validate that the model is learning true pathology—not random noise.

## 🧠 3. Grad-CAM (4-Panel Visualization Across All Classes)

Grad-CAM examples are shown for all four classes:

Cyst Normal Stone Tumor

Each panel includes:

Original Image Grad-CAM Heatmap Grad-CAM Overlay

## 🔎 Crucial for clinical validation and medical AI transparency.

# 📈 4. Quantitative Model Performance
Metric	Score
Validation Accuracy	~76–78%
Loss Function	Binary Cross-Entropy + Dice
Optimizer	Adam
Input Image Size	224×224

## ⚕️ Performance is expected to improve using transfer learning (EfficientNet/MobileNetV3), stronger augmentation, and class-balanced training.

🧪 5. Training Pipeline (MLOps Overview)

This project follows a production-grade ML workflow:

✔ Modular Code src/components, src/pipeline, reusable scripts.

✔ Data Versioning DVC pipelines (dvc.yaml, .dvc folder).

✔ MLflow Tracking Experiment metrics, loss curves, and hyperparameters.

✔ Docker & AWS Ready CI/CD pipeline for EC2 + ECR deployment.

## 🧠 6. Clinical Relevance

Kidney abnormalities—including stones and tumors—require early identification.
This model demonstrates potential for:

Radiology decision support Automated triage Pre-screening imaging workflows

Clinical AI assistants

Grad-CAM ensures that the model remains transparent, interpretable, and clinically trustworthy.
